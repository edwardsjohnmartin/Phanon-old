    <h1>About Phanon</h1>
    <p>Phanon is a website where folks can learn to program. Kind of like lots of other websites out there...but not really!
    Lots of people start learning to program but then get frustrated because it's "too hard". But Phanon walks you through
    programming in a way that is interesting, fun, and builds confidence. <em>In short, it's great.</em></p>

    <p>Here's the tech-speak description. Programming consists of learning two things: problem solving and language syntax.
    The most important thing to learn is problem solving. That's what we're trying to do with computers anyway, right?
    Solve problems! It's the second thing that trips up first-time learners: <strong>the programming language syntax</strong>.
    Here's an example. Suppose you read a sentence that isn't grammatically correct. Yeah, it might be annoying,
    but hey, at least you can probably figure out what is being said anyway. Computers aren't like that! If you write
    computer code that has even one character that isn't right then you're sunk -- the entire computer program will fail to work. 
    Dumb computers.</p>

    <p><i>Enter Phanon.</i> Rather than taking the approach of most learning methods by closing our eyes and hoping that syntax doesn't
    mess you up, we tackle the problem head-on. Phanon walks you through a series of "syntax exercises" that puts that pesky
    syntax stuff into finger muscle memory. Then, when you get to the super-duper problem solving stuff, you don't have to even
    think about how to write a "for loop" <>(don't worry, we'll teach you what that is), let alone spend hours banging your head
    on the table cursing the computer gods that some Monty Python-enamored geek created a language that has infiltrated your 
    peace and prosperity.</p>

    <p>Gradually, as you learn the syntax, we'll teach you the skills to solve problems. Within an hour you'll be writing
    some pretty sweet code that will be cool to even normal, non-computery people (be ready to break out the laptop at
    Thanksgiving and see Aunt Jenny drop-jawed at your creative genius). Did we say an hour? Naw. More like 20 minutes.</p>

    <p><ul><li>So check us out.</li><li> Write some code.</li><li>Gain cred.</li><li>Run for president.</li><li> Win the Nobel Peace Prize.</li></ul>
    It's all right here at your fingertips.
