Should test_out check if the argument passed into is just contained in the students output?
Or should it check if the argument and the students output are the same?

How detailed should the correct and incorrect messages from tests be?
For instance, if an output was missed, should what was supposed to be in the output be in the error message?

Should there be a completed boolean on the ExerciseProgress object?
	Having one would make checking if an exercise is completed cleaner and easier.
	It would be slightly redundant though if we are also tracking what their last correct answer was.
	It could be checked by seeing if the last_correct_contents or last_correct_run_date fields are filled or not.

Is this a good idea?
	An issue from 3PIO was that the due date of projects couldn't be changed per user, only per project.
	There should be a way to allow for this.
	I think having a projectDueDates table should cover it.
	When a project is accessed for a user, it checks if an entry in the table exists.
	The only time an entry gets added to the table is when a special due date has been assigned for that specific user on that specific project.
	If an entry exists, it will use that, if not, it will use the default due date for the project.
