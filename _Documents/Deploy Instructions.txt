To deploy Laravel to a shared hosting account

Host: interserver.net
Web Manager: plesk

Create the database on the host
Export the entire database structure as an .sql file
Import it into the database

Use an ftp client (such as FileZilla) to move the files onto the host server
The structure of the files should be as follows:
	Inside the folder the website points to, move the contents of your Public folder
	Make another folder in that same directory named the same as your project (phanon)
	Move every other folder and file from the project directory into there
It is much faster if you zip the containing folder before moving it with ftp
Once onto the host server, go ahead and unzip the folder 

Make sure the database credentials in the .env file are correct for the database on the server

You will need to change the index.php file from the public directory to point at the correct directory
	Under the "Register the Auto Loader" heading, change the path in the require statement
	Under the "Turn on the Lights" heading, change the path in the require statement
